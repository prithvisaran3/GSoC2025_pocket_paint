# 🎨 Pocket Paint Flutter

A colorful, interactive Flutter drawing app built as part of my **Google Summer of Code 2025** proposal for the Catrobat organization.

This mini-project demonstrates the feasibility of porting Paintroid's core features to a modern Flutter-based Pocket Paint app — with real-time drawing, brush customization, and a vibrant UI.
